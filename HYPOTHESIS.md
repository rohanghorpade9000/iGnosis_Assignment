Older premium customers tend to spend the most, so offering them personalized promotions on premium products could help drive even more revenue.

"Young Singles/Couples - Mainstream" is the biggest customer group, but their spending is only moderate. Bundling products could encourage them to buy more.

The highest spenders, especially the top customer with $1,300 in purchases, could be kept engaged with a tiered loyalty program that rewards their spending.

"Dorito Corn Chip Supreme 380g" is the best-selling and highest-earning product, so making sure itâ€™s always in stock is a must.

Budget-conscious shoppers, particularly "Young Singles/Couples" and "Older Singles/Couples," might spend more with targeted discounts or combo deals.

Since corn chips and crinkle-cut chips are so popular, introducing new flavors or variations in these categories could boost sales even further.
